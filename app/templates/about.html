        <h2>About Typemania</h2>
        <p>This website was created as a personal learning project, exploring various aspects of web development. Features include:</p>
        <h3>Creating a website backend in Python (Flask)</h3>

        </p>
        <h3>Frontend and styling</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Type game is written in JavaScript</li>
                <li>CSS preprocessed with Sass</li>
                <li>HTML generated with Jinja</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Responsive web design</h3>
        <p>The website's design is responsive and scales well down to 320px viewport width</p>
        <h3>European privacy and cookie laws</h3>
        <p>Handling user email addresses and tracking website usage required some research into GDPR compliance and cookie consent law.</p>
        <h3>Sentence generation</h3>
        <p>Sentences are generated by a pseudo-random sentence generator. Using so called <span class="emphasize">sentence models</span>, the script fetches random words with appropriate <span class="emphasize">word type tags</span> from a word database as well as from static assets. Words are transformed automatically if needed (e.g. pluralize nouns, conjugate verbs) and then inserted into the current sentence. Finally, the sentence is served to the game part of the application. At the moment, the sentence generating script has no semantic component and sentences therefore often don't make much sense. This might be addressed in a future update but for the time being sentences are often <span class="emphasize">weird</span>.</p>
