        <h3>Sentences</h3>
        <p>Game sentences are generated by words stored in a database transformed and combined into sentences by a script. At the moment, the sentence generating script has no semantic component and sentences therefore often don't make much sense. This might be addressed in a future update but for the time being sentences are often <span class="emphasize">weird</span>.</p>
