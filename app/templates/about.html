        <h2>About Typemania</h2>
        <p>This website was created as a personal learning project, exploring various aspects of web development. While at times frustrating, creating Typemania.net has been an educational and rewarding experience, expanding my knowledge in certain areas and introducing me to entirely new technologies in others.</p>
        <h3>Creating a website backend in Python (Flask)</h3>
        <p>I learned about routing, app structuring, handling user registration and logins, working with database models, working with a templating engine, logging website activity, sending emails, handling cookies, creating an admin interface, among other things.</p>
        <h3>A little bit of JavaScript</h3>
        <p>The Type game is written in simple vanilla JavaScript. I also learned a thing or two about DOM manipulation and communicating with a website's backend.</p>
        <h3>Styling and Sass</h3>
        <p>I learned the joys of CSS preprocessors, specifically Sass. I learned that CSS is powerful and requires planning and restraint.</p>
        <h3>Responsive web design</h3>
        <p>I learned about the marketshare of small screens and how to make website design responsive. In tests, Typemania.net has looked okay down to about a 300 pixel viewport width.</p>
        <h3>European privacy and cookie laws</h3>
        <p>Handling user email addresses and tracking website usage required some research into GDPR compliance and cookie consent law. Aside from difficulty in interpreting regulations, implementation of compliance with EU law proved a fun technical challenge.</p>
        <h3>Sentence generation</h3>
        <p>Game sentences are generated by words stored in a database transformed and combined into sentences by a script. At the moment, the sentence generating script has no semantic component and sentences therefore often don't make much sense. This might be addressed in a future update but for the time being sentences are often <span class="emphasize">weird</span>.</p>    
        <p>For the sentence generator, I learned how to serve data to the frontend through a simple API.</p>
        <h3>Planning and execution</h3>
        <p><span class="emphasize">Hmm, it would be pretty cool if the website had...</span></p>
        <p>While I had a rough idea about the final product at an early stage, Typemania.net grew organically and without much planning ahead. Unsurprisingly this proved challenging and often confusing. For future projects, I will make sure to spend more time at the drawing board before diving in.</p>
